## General Feedback

Excellent work with your Tamagotchi project Avery! You did a fantastic job for week three and clearly demonstrated you knowledge for a majority of core concepts using jQuery for DOM manipulation. I’ve placed additional feedback in you files in the form of comments so be sure to check those out. Also I noticed you repo contained what appears to be a copy of your project inside of a subdirectory. I wasn’t sure what that was for, but thought I would bring it up as it seemed, like it could have been done by mistake.

## Glows

One of your biggest strengths for week three was your tenacity to find creative ways to add interactivity / functionality to your project. Great job in adding animations and additional images to show different states of the game. You also did a wonderful job with your styling as well.

Overall, very impressive work Avery! Stay strong!

## Grows

One thing I would suggest to improve on is to remove commented out / non-functional code from your master branch. There’s nothing wrong with having commented out code in your repo, but make sure the versions of your code with comments are placed on a different branch. Most developers use a ‘development’ branch to handle versions of their code like this.

## Code Quality

You indentation and naming conventions continue to improve, Avery. Good work here. I did see a couple instances in your .css file where you started a declaration block for a selector, but there were no css rules written inside. Also, for your directory names, it’s always a good idea to name your directories in lower case names. This helps keep your relative file paths more consistent and can also mitigate potential parsing issues in the future.
